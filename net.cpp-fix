If you getting the error when compile :            
            net.cpp:60:1: error: reference to ‘array’ is ambiguous
            array<int, THREAD_MAX> vnThreadsRunning;
            
            Edit your net.cpp file with the follow command mostly in line 57
            
-            array<int, THREAD_MAX> vnThreadsRunning;
+            boost::array<int, THREAD_MAX> vnThreadsRunning;
